# Note: docker-machine on Windows / OS X sometimes gets its time out of sync,
# which can cause SSL verification failures. If this happens, `go get .`, will
# fail. If you run into this problem, run this command at your terminal:
# docker-machine ssh ${machine} 'sudo ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org'
# After that, you can retry `docker build .`.
